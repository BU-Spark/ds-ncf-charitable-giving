### Project Overview

This is our Github for our Spring 2024 CS506 project. We worked with the New Commonwealth Fund (NCF) to understand and visualize trends within philanthropic funding to the Black/LatinX community within Boston over the recent years. Within our deliverables folder, we've added in our report + code for the three milestones throughout the semester, which were Initial Insights Report, Mid-Semester Insights Report, and Final Insights Report. For each of these reports, there is a PDF file describing updates, a powerpoint of our findings, and a Jupyter Notebook that contains all of the code for creating corresponding visualizations for each finding.

In order to re-run the project, a user would simply have to ensure they have the Notebook opened in Google Colab and add a shortcut for the datasets in their own Google Drive. Or, they can download the notebook and update the path links to whatever is most convenient.

We used 3 datatsets from CANDID for our project and they can be found here:
