The project will fund the physical expansion and renovation of our main administrative, clinical, and teaching site at 26 Queen Street, Worcester. This expansion and renovation will allow FHCW to meet the significant increase in demand for primary care, vision care, pharmacy, and dental services for approximately 7,000 new patients. Construction completed to-date to add 18,000 S.F. On th ground floor of the building has provided a fourth primary care team with 20 exam rooms which opened in 12/2013 to provide an estimated 4,835 new patients with access to a primary care medical home; 4 new dental operatories on the third floor, bringing the total to 14, to address the overwhelming demand for urgent/emergency dental treatment and preventive care; a new vision/optical service in partnership with the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences (MCPHS) which opened in 5/2014 to provide eye care for low income,to accommodate 22% increase in our patient population. Family Health Center of Worcester currently provides services for over 33,000 area residents. Phase 2 of the project includes renovations to refresh paint and flooring in 56,000 square feet of existing health center clinical and teaching space to update and repair the facility; construct new nurses stations on 3 existing clinical teams to allow more efficient workflow and consistent work spaces; renovate two storage spaces to convert to office space for improved patient confidentiality in HIV counseling and testing, and health education; and replace aged equipment in disrepair throughout the health center to assure sustainability of operations well into the future."

HFHF is designed to address the underlying causes of a family's homeless episode, and treat the physical and/or mental health conditions that may contribute to job loss, housing loss, the exhaustion of a families' support system and subsequent shelter placement. For 25 years, the HFHF has been the only program in Worcester to provide comprehensive access to health care services for homeless family members of all ages, with coordinated and integrated case management, access to behavioral health care, and trauma-informed primary care. Unlike housing-centered homeless programs, the HFHF assists the most vulnerable women and children in our community by providing wrap-around services at Family Health Center of Worcester (FHCW) structured with an awareness of the devastatingly high rate of violence encountered within homeless families. This past year we saw a 51% increase in the demand for HFHF services and, based upon the continuing high rates of shelter enrollment, we expect the need to continue. The HFHF provides trauma-informed healthcare, coupled with intensive case management to homeless family members so that they emerge from their time in shelter with the tools to navigate the healthcare system for themselves and their families. The goal of the program is to support families to resolve underlying health and trauma issues, and establish goals to move freely along the pathway toward stability and self-sufficiency. The HFHF employs two case managers (family advocates), the HFHF director who provides services as a social worker and supervises the advocates, the HFHF medical director (M.D.), And a consulting psychologist. We request funding to support non-reimbursable case management services needed to provide wrap around, trauma-informed care for the growing number of homeless families."

"Boston Scientific Foundation, Inc.",Teach for America - Massachusetts,"10,000",2015,1 year,Not Specified,Mathematics,Children and youth; Low-income people; Students,Program support,Cash grants,"By 2018, eight million jobs in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) will be available in the United States. Unfortunately, the vast majority of our students will be unprepared to fill them. The root of the problem is the quality of the math and science education in our schools, which disproportionately affects children of color and those from low-income communities and threatens to leave entire groups of students without the skills needed for 21ST century jobs: according to the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress, only 15% of low-income 4TH graders are proficient in science and, by the time they graduate high school, many will not prepared to major in STEM fields in college. Massachusetts is no exception: in 2014, only 1 in 3 low-income students in Massachusetts were proficient or advanced in Mathematics and Science. Meanwhile, more than twice as many non-low income students scored proficient or advanced in both subjects."

The program will operate tentatively 6/ 29 - 8/14. Each weeknight, one recreational facility per team will be open, 5:30 - 9:30PM for a host of activities. Activities typically include: aerobics, arts and crafts, basketball, cooking, games, movies, swimming, volleyball, etc. More structured activities will be determined after the first few weeks of operation. For Youthnet to maximize its effect and service the cities youth who are most at risk, we recognize the need for full time staff to be out in the community during the afternoon hours developing relationships and building trust with our youth. Youthconnect mission is to provide high quality neighborhood-based recreational, educational and cultural activities to isolated and underserved Worcester youth for middle school age youth. Youthconnect emerged from the very successful Youthnet collaboration providing culturally competent developmental summer programs to Worcester's middle school youth for 20 years. Partners include: Boys & Girls Club of Worcester, Friendly House, Girls Inc. Of Worcester, YMCA of Central MA, Y.O.U. Inc., YWCA of Central MA, and Worcester Youth Center. These partners share a commitment to provide year round youth development opportunities to youth who reside in Worcester’s highest environments. Youthconnect has accomplished what no single agency could it has managed to provide healthy alternatives to all of Worcester's subsidized housing complexes and low income neighborhoods it has also provided transportation to all its participants thus reaching the more isolated and undeserved of Worcester's youth. And all of this has been offered at no cost to the participants or their families While offering such a free program has required aggressive fundraising, we realize the feasibility of generating revenues by charging a fee would net minimal funds."

The Family Van proposes expanding its services to a new community, which will allow us to reach hundreds of new clients each year by bringing much needed preventive health care services and health counseling to the underserved. Funding from the Boston Scientific Foundation would allow us to work with community residents, partner organizations, and local health officials to identify and launch a new site in Massachusetts in either Quincy or Saugus."

Our Family Education Program includes adult English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL), U.S. Citizenship classes, an early literacy playgroup for ESOL students’ children ages 0-9, and parent-child literacy activities. We propose that Daniels funding would support hours for our Family Education Coordinator to coordinate adult classes, the early literacy playgroup and parent-child literacy activities; hours for family programming support staff; and for 4 ACE Outreach Workers to provide wraparound support to these families. We will hold family education programming on Saturday mornings from 9:30 A.M. To 1:30 P.M., Running from October 2015 through June 2016. To overcome potential barriers to participation, we provide free on-site childcare through our early literacy playgroup, a free breakfast and lunch, and free bus passes."
