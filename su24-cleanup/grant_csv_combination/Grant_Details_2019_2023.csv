Angell Family Foundation to support recruitment and operating expenses to staff and hire at least 16 site teams serving at least 25 Chicago public schools during the 2022-2023 school year. Saga has a multi-year contract with Chicago Public Schools. Saga program expenses not covered by the district include recruitment, widespread digital marketing for talent, HR support for Chicago teams, and other Chicago-related administrative, supportive, and operational services. Saga’s program is delivered by a team of Americorps Members managed by a Site Director (SD). Each Member works in groups of 2 to 4 students in a dedicated Saga classroom for a full period within the students’ schedules. Members support students’ grade-level and foundational mathematics skills, and SDS oversee the classroom and Members and also coordinate with school staff. In the Traditional Model, Members meet with students daily; in the Blended Learning model, students alternate daily between tutorials with their Member and independent practice using an adaptive practice tool. Both models are adaptable and can be implemented remotely in the event of district-wide school closures. Members who are selected exhibit strong math and interpersonal skills and show a commitment to racial equity and education. To make a year of service more accessible to community members, Saga accepts candidates who hold Associate degrees as well as Bachelor's degrees, and recruitment and hiring of locals is prioritized; it is critical to Saga that our tutors reflect the students and communities with whom we work. In the 20-21 school year, 52% of Saga's national cohort identified as people of color; 45% of this same cohort identified as female, 38% identified as male, and 10% opted out of identifying their gender; 75% of the cohort identified as recent college graduates, 17% as early career professionals, 1% as mid-career professionals, and 7% as retirees."

Specifically, it will provide an assessment of changes in elective, nonelective, and emergent surgical procedures and medical admissions from March 2020 through the end of the first quarter of 2021 and compare these admissions to those in 2019. The project will examine whether outcomes varied for these procedures during the pandemic stratified by key patient characteristics (e.G., Payer type, race, age, sex) and hospital characteristics (e.G., Urban/rural, teaching hospital, safety net). It also will measure the changes in revenue experienced by different hospital types. Analyses for utilization will be conducted using the Premier Healthcare Database (PHD), a large U.S.-Hospital-based, service-level, all-payer database that contains information on 45 percent of all U.S. Hospital discharges from nearly 800 diverse hospitals. Vizient Clinical Database and Revenue files, another discharge-based, all-payer database, will be used to assess changes in hospital revenue."

As we recognize 30 Elm Street as the headquarters, we are dedicated to maintaining/expanding our audience and partnerships while providing alternatives to “museum visits” to maintain/expand our engagement with our diverse community. The COVID challenge redirects our energy/commitment to greater digital access, increased virtual programs, and more onsite “museum” interactions with the stories and peoples of Worcester. This “new” community-essential museum requires new investments in technology, community relations, and branding. WHM’S core mission is to serve our communities. We intend to maintain and grow important programs for a flourishing virtual audience. WHM requests support to 1) continue to build, secure, document, and archive the digital collection (COVID-19 CHRONICLES: Worcester's Community Archive), 2) continue parallel efforts with Latino History Project, LGBTQ+, and Worcester Black History Project, 3) continue to create online programs, tours, presentations, and educational opportunities.

HHF assists the most vulnerable families in our community by providing wrap-around services structured with an awareness of the high rate of violence and other trauma experienced by homeless families. HHF provides services to homeless families living in area family shelters and domestic violence shelters, as well as families who are identified as homeless during a healthcare visit and referred by their physician. The goals of the program are to identify and treat the underlying health issues and trauma that contribute to homelessness and to support families as they make progress on the path to stability and self-sufficiency. In April 2020, 43% of individuals experiencing homelessness who were tested were found to be infected with coronavirus. As COVID-19 continues to impact our communities, FHCW will continue to meet families’ needs and will continue to support community-based testing, monitoring, and contact tracing. FHCW is soliciting private funds to purchase 3 telehealth consoles to be located within shelter sites to provide access to telemedicine via virtual medical and behavioral health visits to address critical needs."

"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.","Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange, Inc.","5,000",2021,1 year,Youth,Foster care,At-risk youth; Victims and oppressed people,Advocacy; Program support,Cash grants,"MARE is respectfully requesting a $7,500 operating grant to support its work in the Greater Worcester area finding forever families for vulnerable special needs children, sibling groups, children of color and teens in foster care. There are 8,600 children in the foster care system in Massachusetts. These children have been removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect. Some will be reunited with their birth parents; others will be adopted by family members or close friends. 1,300 Have a goal of adoption but no family member or identified resource that has come forward to offer permanency. Many of them have nowhere to go. Of the 740 children currently on MARE's caseload, 20% come from Greater Worcester - what we call the Central Region. These children face the prospect of growing up in foster care, eventually aging out of the system with no supports. The outcomes for this unsupported population are extremely grim; they are more likely to have experienced multiple foster care placements, drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy, homelessness, unemployment, sexual abuse, and incarceration. The challenges of the pandemic has hit the child services arena hard. We are especially concerned for the well-being of our foster children during this confusing time, when they already suffer from incredible isolation and despair. Additionally, as evident from past experience, we know that the child welfare system is bracing for a tidal wave due to the COVID-19 epidemic.."
"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.",WORCESTER INTERFAITH,"5,000",2021,1 year,Health,Diseases and conditions,People of African descent; People of Latin American descent; Victims of disaster,Public engagement and education; Network-building and collaboration; Equal access,Cash grants,"Black, Latino, Immigrant & Undocumented families have many barriers that make exposure to COVID 19 greater. These inequities and barriers range from racial, class and immigration inequities and prejudices to housing, economic, to being employed in the service industry & exposed to occupation and environmental hazards. Latinos have 2.5 X higher prevalence of COVID in Worcester than White folks; and Black folks have a prevalence of COVID 2.7X more than White folks. While Latinos are only 21% of the population they are 37% of COVID 19 cases, Blacks or African American are only 13% of the population but represent 22% of COVID19 cases. Whites represent 69% of the population but only 46% of the COVID cases. We've seen solutions that are not centered from culturally appropriate, multilingual approaches that don't reach our communities. This will not get the message to our most at-risk residents. Lastly, if we are asking the community to practice proper hand washing, wear masks, practice social distancing, get tested & vaccinated; we need to educate the community on how to do what is being recommended. This means having instructional materials accessible. Create images for community members that are not literate. Translate materials into various languages. We can't just tell people what to do, we need to model it and we need to provide the resources so that they can be successful in preventing the spread of COVID. We also need to remove the barriers to get tested and vaccinated."
"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.",Bottom Line,"5,000",2021,1 year,Youth,Disasters and emergency management,Low-income people,Equal access; Program support,Cash grants,"Bottom Line is requesting support to continue our impactful 1:1 advising for students from low-income backgrounds in Worcester as they are enrolled in colleges across the Commonwealth; support which is critical to meet students’ increased needs during the COVID-19 crisis. As students’ ability to return to school settings remains in constant flux, we recognize that without intervention and support, students from low-income backgrounds will continue to see the highest rates of disengagement from school and degree paths – even before the pandemic, 70% of students from high-income backgrounds graduated from college compared to only 20% of their low-income peers. In March, we shifted our programming to provide virtual advising support and emergency resources for students. We continue to adjust our work with students to meet their evolving challenges and combat the potential long-lasting negative impacts on the lives of students, their families, and the greater Worcester community. This program year, Advisors continue to provide remote support via video, phone, and text communication with: course registration, job and internship preparation, resume support, and FAFSA renewal. Advisors are also helping students navigate anxiety about the impact of the income loss on their ability to pay for school on top of other family needs; remote learning; a narrowing job market; and all the other unknowns that characterize this difficult time."

Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, WYC has continued to provide programming, services, and connection to Worcester’s at-risk and disconnected youth. As WYC continues to evaluate the best methods of safely providing programming in a changing environment, the organization is taking a multi-pronged approach—online, hybrid, and onsite programming. WYC’s nimble response to the circumstances and restrictions of the pandemic has allowed the organization to provide a consistent connection for youth who are experiencing the isolation and uncertainty brought by the pandemic. Funding from the Daniels Foundation would support WYC as the organization provides consistent programming to its participants through a time of uncertainty."

Program activity details: 12 courses X 3 trimesters X 9 weeks each Courses offered at 3 levels: survival, beginner, intermediate Class activities include reading articles, watching videos, discussions, dialogues, role play, writing prompts, and games. Our teachers employ a communicative approach to English language instruction, which focuses on real, authentic language for everyday use. Many activities focus on daily needs like helping family members, making appointments, work-related language skills, and communication for social inclusion. In response to COVID-19, we shifted to remote instruction in March 2020. We are continuing to offer these courses online, because the demand has remained consistent and many of our students have been struggling to access the COVID-19 vaccine. Immigrants and BIPOC are disproportionately under-vaccinated. While we are all in the same storm, we are not all in the same boat. This sentiment especially rings true for English learners. Those who cannot read, write, or speak English proficiently may not understand the rapidly evolving situation and what they can do to care for themselves and their families. We have been helping our students find vaccine clinics, sharing the latest information, and aiding their language development toward independence and self-sufficiency. Education provides critical shelter from the storm."

WI engages women to empower girls, ages 10-14, through support of local gender-specific programming aimed to build, strengthen, and support the development of healthy, safe and confident girls. A specialized girl’s leadership program would allow WI to engage alumnae of WI-funded programs as active WI members and provide them with tailored mentoring, leadership skills, and opportunities for growth. This program would expand WI’s programming reach to a diverse group of girls aged 15-19 to support their development into contributing young women leaders and philanthropists. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, WI has had to reimagine girl’s programming for a virtual world and help address the changing needs of funded programs in order to reach, engage, and support girls during this difficult time. Furthermore, it has raised our awareness of the importance of establishing a pipeline strategy for leadership advancement for diverse women who are representative of WI’s supported communities. A girl's leadership program would help provide extra support and developmental opportunities for girls during and following the pandemic while allowing WI to promote diversity, racial equity, and inclusion within our membership."

Best Buy Foundation,Clubhouse Network Inc,"200,000",2020,1 month,Teens & Tech; Career Readiness,STEM education,Preteens; Adolescents; Economically disadvantaged people; Students,Capital and infrastructure,Cash grants,"Best Buy and TCN are committed to preparing teens from underserved communities for the tech-reliant jobs of the future. In BBTTCS and Clubhouses around the world, young people are given access to state-of-the-art technology, training, and mentorship to help them reach their full potential. Youth are immersed in creative expression with professional software and are engaged in scientific inquiry, engineering design, computer programming, and the real-world application of STEM principles in ways that feel relevant and meaningful to them. As they engage in informal learning, they imagine, create, experiment, share, reflect, imagine again, and improve their processes. Youth in our program are passionate about the opportunity to use technology to develop something for the greater good; the chance to learn through hands-on, project-based experiences; the emphasis on collaboration, problem-solving, and teamwork; and the possibility to interact with professionals working in STEM fields. Teens at BBTTCS and Clubhouses are encouraged to work on projects -- such as illustrations, videos, music, 3-D models, and much more -- and then share projects with teens around the world for collaboration and feedback, as well as to inspire others. This sharing currently occurs on an outdated web platform called The Clubhouse Village. Teens also post how-to tutorials on the Village when they develop an expertise, and TCN posts periodic Studio 52 Challenges with examples to inspire teens and mentors to try something new. The Village is also used to connect and foster collaboration among teens in advance of -- and following -- TCN'S global Teen Summit. Often Teen Tech Center and Clubhouse staff express that their teens rarely have a chance to leave their own neighborhoods, let alone have connections with young people from other countries around the world. The Village provides not only inspiration but a sense of global community and understanding. The current Clubhouse Village is built on an older version of Ruby on Rails. Not only is this version in danger of failing in the near future, but it is also unable to scale to meet our business requirements. We propose upgrading this platform to allow for modern functionality and features, with a goal of creating an online home for community, creativity, and collaboration which will encourage teens to hone their skills and work with peers around the world. TCN has already developed a list of criteria for a new platform. This list includes customization, modifications, mobile responsiveness, and internationalization. As part of this project, TCN will solicit proposals from developers to identify the best match for the project. At its core, the site is very successful in allowing users to create and post their creations. In the future we want to ensure the new site will build community around this feature, for example through following individual members or specific projects."

Angell Family Foundation to support recruitment and operating expenses to staff and hire at least 16 site teams serving at least 20 Chicago public schools during the ‘21-’22 school year. Expenses associated with Saga’s program not covered by the district contract include: costs for job postings and ads, HR support for Chicago teams, and other Chicago-related administrative, support, and operational services. Saga’s program, Math Lab, is delivered by a team of Americorps Members and managed by a Site Director. Each Member works with 2 to 4 students, in a dedicated Saga classroom, for a full period within the students’ daily schedule. In the Traditional Model, Members meet with students daily; in the Blended Learning model, students attend Math Lab daily, but alternate between tutorials with their Member and independent practice using the ALEKS adaptive practice tool. Members support students’ grade-level and foundational mathematics skills. Site Directors manage the classroom, meet with school staff, and observe Members to develop their best practice instruction. Per the district’s request, 15 of 20 Saga school sites will implement the Blended Learning model. Both models are adaptive and can be implemented remotely in the event of district-wide school closures. Saga’s team is working with the district to develop implementation plans for each potential re-opening scenario. Saga recruits our Members from a pool of recent college graduates, career changers, and retirees who are dedicated to ending educational inequity. The Recruitment Team prioritizes strategies that diversify our teams; this year 62% of Saga’s cohort identify as people of color. In response to the nationwide shutdowns related to the spread of COVID-19, Saga’s recruitment team has shifted to exclusively online recruiting. Excluding the limitation to online spaces, Saga’s recruitment team will maintain their current recruitment protocol this year."

The continued extraction of oil used to create plastic contributes to climate change, and plastic waste, from single-use plastic bags and disposable containers to drinking straws, pollute our precious oceans. As the issue has heated up over the years, we’re learning even more about the dangerous impacts of our plastic addiction. Communities in the Ohio Valley and Gulf Coast have experienced serious health impacts from petrochemical leaks and explosions, and the industry is investing in even more ethane crackers and seeking to expand their profits from plastics. Studies are finding alarming amounts of microplastics in people all around the world with unknown long term health impacts. Meanwhile, China has stopped taking our contaminated recyclables, tanking the recycling rate of plastics even more and flooding southeast Asian countries with trash. If the petrochemical industry builds the number of new plastic plastic production plants they’re currently planning, we’ll be locked into a single-use plastic future for decades to come. It is critical for us to take action now towards a plastic free future. College students have a large role to play in the fight to end plastic pollution. For decades, students have been at the forefront of the environmental movement—from Earth Day and fighting back against toxic products to helping win the California bag ban. The Student PIRGs (Public Interest Research Groups) focus on the big challenges facing our society. Through their determination, energy, and drive, students working with their PIRG chapters can—and have—helped to win huge victories for our planet and our future. Created on college campuses 45 years ago, we have built the nation’s most effective youth civic engagement network, consisting of 501(C)(3) and 501(C)(4) student-directed and funded organizations on more than 37 college campuses in eight states, more than 50 professional organizing and policy staff, 300,000 dues-paying student members, and 5,000 volunteers annually (with 1,500 students taking on significant leadership responsibilities). The Student PIRGs have taken on national leadership in the U.S. Break Free From Plastics Movement and helped craft the threefold movement strategy which we have adopted internally: 1. Shift demand to disincentivize single-use plastics production: We need to demonstrate to major plastics purchasers that single-use plastic is bad business. By doing so, we’ll disincentivize the oil and gas industry from putting their proverbial nest egg in plastic production by showing that it is not economically viable. Tactically, this means we’re working with the movement to expand producer responsibility, get institutions and corporations to stop purchasing single-use plastics, and to change consumer culture towards one of reuse, while our 501(C)(4) affiliates work to pass bills that ban single-use plastic."

However, underserved communities, particularly racial and ethnic minorities (REM) are consistently underrepresented in clinical trials. REM communities face unique barriers preventing their engagement and participation in research that include (a) low health and research literacy; (B) poor or inconsistent relationships between their communities and researchers; and (C) deep distrust of the academic medical research model. To address these compounded barriers and improve levels of trust and engagement from REM, this proposal advances a transparent, accessible model focused on sustained outreach and education on health and healthcare literacy. We propose up to 18 virtual events in 2021, designed to ensure that participants leverage resources to learn about health and the social determinants that contribute to their well-being, particularly health, medicine, research and insurance literacies. During these events, participants will hear from clinicians, researchers, and nonprofit and trusted community partners followed by interactive events to ensure that literacy efforts are quickly utilized in a manner relevant for each community. We will initially focus on communities with large racial and ethnic minority populations in Boston, MA."

"Amgen Foundation, Inc.",Health Resources in Action,"25,000",2020,1 year,"Cambridge, MA",Engineering,Academics,Internships,Cash grants,"The LEAH Project is a STEM-focused program that builds a love of science among youth typically underrepresented in STEM fields (e.G. Youth of color, low-income youth, first-generation college students). LEAH prepares youth to develop an interest in and pursue STEM topics in higher education and future careers, where they may access high-paying jobs in fields where minorities have historically been underrepresented. To this end, LEAH provides its high school-aged participants with a variety of STEM internship opportunities including STEM teaching internships, biomedical research internships, and general STEM internships. LEAH is seeking support from the Amgen Foundation to support the LEAH Knox Scholars Biomedical Research program (LKS) which is aligned with the Foundation's community life and science education priorities. This year, LKS will provide 48 Boston area youth typically underrepresented in STEM fields with paid biomedical research internships. Participants, known as Knox Scholars, participate in a five-week intensive biology course at MIT to gain basic lab skills. The following summer, Knox Scholars participate in paid internships in academic or corporate laboratories where they apply the skills they learned at MIT. By providing experiential learning opportunities, LKS addresses the disparities youth typically underrepresented in STEM face in accessing a STEM career."

These funds will be used by BSCP to provide students/fellows from underrepresented populations in medicine and science (particularly Black/African Americans, Hispanics/Latinx and Native Americans/Alaska Natives) and disadvantaged individuals with resources, mentoring and information to aid in their academic and career development through conferences, workshops, symposia, newsletters and virtual resources. The overarching goals of all BSCP initiatives are to work towards a more socially just society, to close the equity gap for people of color, and ultimately help diversify the biomedical sciences and health professions to mirror the communities they serve. All BSCP initiatives are always offered at no cost to participants."

In addition, Enroot will curate a series of tech literacy workshops to support the growing demand for fluency needed in a distance learning environment. In a moment where immigrant English Learner students' need for academic and social-emotional support is critical, Enroot will allocate more staff time to compile access resources and provide case management, mental health, and well-being services to our students in response to challenges faced by the reality of COVID-19."

Eureka! Brings girls to UMass each summer for workshops to build 21ST century skills. 1ST and 2ND year girls work with volunteer faculty instructors in classes like Creative Computing with Scratch (students build Scratch apps that use external inputs including smart phones); Making Everyday Things Smarter (the Internet of Things (Iot)--electronics, embedded systems, and mobile phone development); and Smart Things That Are Changing The World (experience with quantum dots, nano materials that are used in state-of-the-art lighting and displays). Girls in their 3RD year spend 4 weeks at STEM organizations, using technology in real world settings and learning firsthand about STEM careers. Opportunities include: Holyoke Codes--externs enter a soccer robotics competition using Java Script, help younger campers learn Scratch coding, and learn Python through interactive challenges; and Holyoke Media--externs use video/sound recording, editing and production to create a documentary video. Girls in Years 4 and 5 focus on college readiness. Year 4 girls take a no-cost SAT prep course at Bay Path University, helping to close the achievement gap for girls from low income families, and Year 5 girls take a college credit course at Bay Path, building a college transcript while still in high school. Teens from low income families rarely have access to the expensive camps and afterschool programs that teach digital skills, or the personal connections that lead to internships. Eureka! Helps close the digital divide by providing these girls with no-cost access to a broad range of STEM experiences. All five years of Eureka! Integrate digital skill-building, preparing girls for success in STEM fields in which women of color continue to be under-represented."

These approaches are: 1) Discovering Youth Leadership & Building Community - this approach has been a main pillar of BAGLY's programming for over 40 years, and has become a necessary lifeline for generations of LGBTQ+ youth. Arguably, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this opportunity to connect with peers, develop self-advocacy skills, and learn about health risks, has never been more important. 2) Promoting Health and Wellness - To complement the social-emotional wellbeing of LGBTQ+ youth, BAGLY provides clinical services (due to resume by October 2020), behavioral and mental health services, and peer-led support groups that are all aimed at reducing negative health outcomes and removing systemic barriers for LGBTQ+ youth, especially youth of color, homeless or unstably-housed youth, and transgender and non-binary youth. 3) Shaping Policy and Practice - BAGLY trains and support youth leaders to advocate at city, state, and national levels in order to reduce the disparities faced by them in their communities, schools, and jobs. For years, BAGLY's three priority populations within the LGBTQ+ youth communities have been LGBTQ+ youth of color, homeless LGBTQ+ youth, and transgender and non-binary youth."

Through Bizgrow, LCR and our partners build wealth and economic justice in low-income communities of color and immigrant communities through entrepreneurship and small business ownership. We provide free legal assistance, business support, and technical assistance to minority, immigrant, and women business owners--ensuring they encounter fewer obstacles and more opportunities. From family-owned restaurants to green economy startups, these businesses play an important role in their local communities--helping individuals achieve self-sufficiency, creating jobs, and contributing to the vibrancy of our Commonwealth. All Bizgrow participants are low- or moderate-income and reflect the rich diversity of the region. Languages spoken include Spanish, Portuguese, Haitian-creole, Mandarin, and Khmer. Our programming is linguistically and culturally sensitive to effectively engage and serve this community. 2021-22 Goals 1. Close knowledge, opportunity, resource, and network gaps in low-income communities of color and immigrant communities through free legal support and technical assistance; and 2. Position entrepreneurs of color at the forefront of recovery efforts and key expanding and emerging sectors (food, cannabis, arts and culture, and sustainability) -- where they can lead and benefit from economic opportunities."

HHF assists the most vulnerable families in our community by providing wrap-around services at FHCW structured with an awareness of the high rate of violence and other trauma experienced by homeless families. HHF provides services to homeless families living in area family shelters and domestic violence shelters, as well as families who are identified as homeless during a healthcare visit and referred by their physician. The goals of the program are to identify and treat the underlying health issues and trauma that contribute to homelessness and to support families as they make progress on the path to stability and self-sufficiency. On July 1, 2019 FHCW assumed responsibility for the Homeless Outreach and Advocacy Program (HOAP) that provides primary care to homeless adults, formerly operated by Community Healthlink. HOAP and HHF remain in separate locations and have separate budgets, but they have been joined in name under the umbrella term Worcester Healthcare for the Homeless."

Every week, we deliver five days’ worth of medically tailored lunches, dinners, and snacks to severely ill residents in the City of Worcester and surrounding areas, their dependent children and caregivers. 94% Of our clients live in poverty and our clients are battling more than 35 different illnesses such as HIV and cancer. Our immediate priority is to make sure our clients do not go hungry despite the debilitating effects of a devastating illness and scarce economic resources. Our goals are to help keep our clients out of emergency rooms, support medical treatments, relieve clients of the burdens of shopping/food preparation, and provide economic assistance to low-income households. Due to unmet demand for our medically tailored meals, we recently completed construction of a 31,000 square foot “food Campus” on our Jamaica Plain property. With the Foundation’s support, we will expand our Nutrition Program for Worcester & Worcester County Residents Affected by Critical & Chronic Illness to take advantage of the increased capacity afforded by our new “food Campus.” In FY21, we will deliver 40,000 made-from-scratch meals to 160 Worcester County residents. More than 70% of medically tailored meals will be delivered to clients residing within the City of Worcester."

Over twenty years ago, Bottom Line opened its doors with a high-impact, one-on-one coaching program aiming to increase the graduation rate for low-income, first-generation-to-college students in Massachusetts. Only one in eleven low-income students that get into college actually graduate and Bottom Line has developed a proven model to ensure students are four times more likely to graduate. Our Success Advisors travel to college campuses to meet with students in-person multiple times throughout the year with a codified curriculum to ensure they can overcome any obstacles that might get in the way of earning their degree. As a result, over 74% percent of our students have earned a college degree within six years. Through our programs we empower students to take ownership of their educational journeys and build self-confidence, so they can advocate for themselves within their institutions."

We are the only medically tailored meal provider in Massachusetts, delivering nutritious meals to the doorsteps of food-insecure, homebound, and severely ill clients. Over the next fiscal year, we will deliver 40,000 medically tailored meals to 160 low-income residents of Worcester County affected by critical and chronic illnesses, such as cancer, HIV, and diabetes. 70% Of our current Worcester County clients reside within the city of Worcester, and Worcester is the second largest city we serve. Our clients are severely immunocompromised and high-risk for COVID-19. As we work to maintain service for these clients, we are rapidly expanding our kitchen production during the current public health crisis to start 25 new clients per day, including those from Worcester County. We have secured state designation as a Critical Services Provider, giving us authorization to access areas that may be barred from the general public due to the emergency. In order to maintain and expand kitchen production, we seek additional funding for emergency food purchases and the temporary hire of van drivers so we have the capacity to home-deliver more meals to high-risk/high-need clients in Worcester County."

Since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, Community Servings has faced unprecedented levels of demand for our medically tailored meals in Worcester county and across the Commonwealth. We have rapidly adapted every aspect of our business operations and increased our production levels by 50%, from 10,000 to 15,000 meals produced each week. In FY21, we expect to further deepen our presence in Worcester county and provide more than 60,000 medically tailored meals to 190 low-income Worcester county residents affected by severe illnesses such as cancer, HIV, and diabetes. This represents a 50% increase in meal projections and a 20% increase in client projections, compared to FY20. Our clients are mobility-impaired and are unable to cook for themselves or access other nutritional services, rendering them extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. As the Commonwealth reopens and the state begins recovery from coronavirus, our severely ill Worcester county clients and community members are still at significant risk and are unable to leave their homes to access the nutritious food they need. Community Servings will continue ramping up production levels to reach these populations in need."

Stone Soup is a social justice organization with over a decade of community building, fundraising, and building management experience. We rebuilt after a fire damaged the building in 2009 and reopened in 2014. Now after five years of constant use, the building needs a number of repairs and renovations. The project will address safety (the existing garage is a hazard and must be demolished, and two trees must be removed); security (new windows/screens, locks, security system) to deter break-ins; correction of projects which contractors in 2014 didn’t do correctly (gutters, floorings); storage (Worcester Earn-a-bike needs more storage for donated bikes, and the new garage will double in size); and an opportunity to fulfill the promise of our courtyard with a wall mural, landscaping, and plantings. Work has already started taking place this year, as we have been raising funds since February. Multiple components are independent of each other and are being done as we raise funds. At the top of the list are removing the unsafe garage and tree removal, followed by replacing the community room floor and an office floor, both in very poor shape. Having already secured four grants and donations from individuals, we solicited two bids for the garage and flooring, the highest priorities. We got bids from Homes ICG (Irving Espinosa) and CF Construction (Camarqui Franco). The committee approved hiring ICG as construction manager who is bringing in CF Construction for garage work. Also, the courtyard mural was completed in April, funded in part by a Creative Spark Grant from Greater Worcester Community Foundation."

Through the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, WYC has continued to provide programming, services, and connection to Worcester’s at-risk and disconnected youth. As WYC continues to evaluate the best methods of safely providing programming in a changing environment, the organization is taking a multi-pronged approach—online, hybrid, and onsite programming. WYC’s nimble response to the circumstances and restrictions of the pandemic has allowed the organization to provide a consistent connection for youth who are experiencing the isolation and uncertainty brought by the pandemic. Funding from the Daniels Foundation would support WYC as the organization provides consistent programming to its participants through a time of uncertainty."

WYC took a week to restructure programming; set up online services and accounts; train staff; and communicate with participants. As of March 30, 2020, utilizing Zoom, WYC offers daily online programming, group meetups, and individual check-ins with staff. This programming pattern will be expanded to provide increased opportunities for participants. WYC will continue to work to ensure all program participants are able to connect to the program(s) which are included in their plan and/or of interest to them. WYC will provide tablets to participants who need the technology in order to be able to participate in online programming. WYC will incorporate online outreach to continue to connect with at-risk Worcester youth during a difficult time for the community, families, and youth. Further, WYC continues to plan for re-opening the physical site in compliance with any requirements set forth by the Commonwealth, to include site sanitation, required inspections, ongoing testing, etc. In anticipation of potential ongoing/rolling restrictions due to the virus, WYC plans to continue online outreach and programming following the site re-opening."
"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.","Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Mass/Metrowest, Inc.","5,000",2020,1 year,"Basic Needs (Food, shelter)",Basic and emergency aid,Low-income people,Emergency funds; Program support,Cash grants,"Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Mass/Metrowest (BBBSCM/MW) recently created the Emergency Relief Fund, as a component of the Defend Potential Fund, to serve the emergency needs of the “littles” (mentees) families we serve in the 42 towns and communities of Central Massachusetts and Metrowest. The Defend Potential fund was created in March to help BBBSCM/MW ensure sustainability during Covid-19. We humbly request $10,000 from The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation to provide emergency funds for the children’s families we serve in the Worcester region. In 2019, BBBSCM/MW served 750 “littles” in Worcester County; 88% of the all of the program participants qualify for free/reduced lunch and are living in poverty. The children who participate in the program face significant barriers to future success; barriers that BBBSCM/MW helps address through positive mentor support. Many program participants are considered minorities: 42% are Hispanic, African-american, or Multi-race. 48% Live with a single parent. We strongly believe that given the economic and social circumstances of the children we serve in Worcester area – the Covid-19 pandemic would have exacerbated the economic situation of hundreds of families. The Emergency Relief fund is available for families that we serve who are currently going through financial difficulty and deprived of access to important necessities. The Emergency Fund money would go towards rent, utilities, phone, internet, and/or food assistance."
"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.",Quinsigamond Community College Foundation,"5,000",2020,1 year,"Basic Needs (Food, shelter)",Disaster relief,Economically disadvantaged people; Victims of disaster,Emergency funds; Program support,Cash grants,"We request funds to support the most underserved college students in Worcester during COVID-19 pandemic. While the CARES Act granted aid to college students who transitioned to remote education due to COVID-19, most underserved students were excluded from the aid: international, undocumented, workforce training, ESL, high school completion, and part-time students. The aid reimbursed expenses from transitioning to remote learning: computers, hot spots, and internet. Expenses resulting from the economic impact of the pandemic such as job loss were not reimbursable. In March, the Foundation allocated $25K for an emergency fund supporting all students with needs resulting from COVID-19. • Data shows that those who received aid: 45% did not qualify for other aid, 46% lost their jobs, 70% had less working hours, and 32% had COVID related medical expenses. Most used the aid to cover economic impact expenses: rent, mortgage, groceries, utilities, transportation, student loans, and healthcare. • The aid was crucial for student success: 75% said it allowed them to stay in college and perform better in classes, 78% said it reduced stress caused by financial constraints due to COVID, and 94% did not withdraw from QCC. • The aid helped the most underserved: 81% women, 56% racial minorities, 43% immigrants, 65% parents, 28% enrolled in adult learner and workforce programs. The emergency aid solidifies the Foundation’s mission: eliminate barriers that prevent students’ success."
"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.","Massachusetts Adoption Resource Exchange, Inc.","5,000",2020,1 year,Youth,Foster care,At-risk youth,Advocacy; Equal access; Program support,Cash grants,"MARE is respectfully requesting a $10,000 operating grant to support its work in the Greater Worcester area finding forever families for vulnerable special needs children, sibling groups, and teens in foster care. These populations are also disproportionately children of color. There are 8,600 children in the foster care system in Massachusetts. These children have been removed from their homes due to abuse or neglect. Some will be reunited with their birth parents; others will be adopted by family members or close friends. 1,200 Have a goal of adoption but no family member or identified resource that has come forward to offer permanency. Many of them have nowhere to go. Of the 733 children currently on MARE's caseload, 20% come from Greater Worcester - what we call the Central Region. These children face the prospect of growing up in foster care, eventually aging out of the system with no supports. The outcomes for this unsupported population are extremely grim; they are more likely to have experienced multiple foster care placements, drug and alcohol abuse, teen pregnancy, homelessness, unemployment, sexual abuse, and incarceration. Permanency -- a lifelong familial connection -- is vital to avoid these disparities. MARE addresses this by providing waiting children with opportunities to come to the attention of potential adoptive parents in positive and creative ways; and recruiting, supporting, and advocating for families to advance them toward successful adoptions."

Participants are likely to represent communities of color, live in poverty, have been exposed to substance abuse, gang violence, health disparities, interpersonal violence, homelessness, etc. They are also likely to be the first in their families to attend college. Girls CHOICE has a documented history of improving the lives of Worcester girls, especially girls of color, by helping middle and high school girls to: • Increase their rates of graduation • Reduce the incidence of violence in their lives • Recognize and understand the qualities of healthy and unhealthy relationships • Learn about and develop goal setting and planning skills • Develop positive relationships and values Through the program's long-term structure and support, girls develop the skills, habits, resiliency, and relationships needed for them to become self-reliant adults. Due to the COVID-19 epidemic, program participants and their families are currently experiencing additional financial stressors. The Girls CHOICE program is helping to meet the needs of the girls and their families by providing food, supplies, and gift cards. Due to social distancing restrictions, the regular weekly program is being delivered remotely rather than in person."

ACE outreach workers help parents to find employment, access healthcare and renew food stamps. Presently, we are communicating weekly with our clients through phone, text and video chat, helping them to access services, making referrals and facilitating communication with their landlords, doctors and workplaces. Our new part-time outreach staff will also provide remote ESOL instruction through weekly phone calls to adult students to review English lessons and practice speaking in English."

Over the past three years, the Angell Family Foundation’s generous investment has allowed us to serve over 6,300 students. With your support, Onegoal has built a core model that works, and we’ve learned a lot along the way. To date 82% of Onegoal’s high school graduates have enrolled in college, and of those, 78% are on track for or have graduated with a college degree. Onegoal places emphasis on designing solutions with and for students who face additional systemic barriers to postsecondary success – students of color, first generation college students, students with lower academic profiles, and students attending under-resourced high schools. On average, students enter Onegoal with a GPA at or below a 2.75 GPA and an SAT diagnostic score at or below their schools’ average. During the 2018 fiscal year, 95% of the students served by Onegoal were eligible for free or reduced lunch at Chicago Public Schools. Our tested model includes rigorous teacher coaching and support; targeted student selection; an in-school, credit-bearing college access and success course delivered daily during junior and senior years of high school; intensive academic, social, and financial coaching for students during freshman year of college; and robust partnerships with colleges whose graduation rates and student support practices outpace peers at similar selectivity levels. As we continue to scale in Chicago, we remain rigorously focused on expanding our service area while maintaining industry-leading results. We respectfully ask the Angell Family Foundation to consider investing in Onegoal once more with a gift of $100,000 per year over two years to help us further extend our service area and broaden our impact to more underserved students across Chicago Public Schools."

Paul M. Angell Family Foundation,"SAGA Innovations, Inc.","100,000",2019,1 year,School Achievement and Completion,Tutoring,Adolescents; Low-income people; Students,General support,Cash grants,"Saga requests general operating funds from the Paul M. Angell Family Foundation to support our Americorps Member and program-staff recruitment and operating expenses for at least 14 site teams that will serve at least 18 Chicago public schools in 2020-2021. Saga’s program, Math Lab, is delivered by a team of Americorps Members and managed by a Site Director. Each Member works with two to four students, in a dedicated Saga classroom, for a full period within the students’ daily schedule. In the Traditional Model, Members meet with students daily; in the Blended Learning model, students attend Math Lab daily, but alternate between tutorials with their Member and independent practice on the ALEKS platform. Members utilize tutorial time to support students’ grade-level work and to remediate students’ basic mathematics skills. Site Directors manage the classroom, meet with school staff, and observe Members to help provide the best instruction to students. Next year, most Saga sites will implement the Blended Learning model because the per pupil price is much lower and the academic gains for students appear to be on par with those of the Traditional Model. Saga recruits our Members from a pool of recent college graduates, career changers, and retirees who are dedicated to ending educational inequity. The Recruitment Team prioritizes strategies that diversify our pool of candidates because it is a crucial component of impactful student-member relationships. This year 54% of Saga’s cohort identify as people of color. A grant from the Paul M. Angell foundation would support Saga recruitment efforts for the ‘20-’21 school year including: fees for campus events/career fairs, recruiter travel to priority-colleges (HBCUs and HSIs), stipends for on-campus student ambassadors, marketing materials, and extensive digital marketing campaigns. Support for our recruiting efforts will ensure that we attract diverse, high-quality applicants for the ‘20-’21 Chicago cohort."

Our arts complex includes a 340 seat Main Stage theater, a 100 seat Black Box, 3 floors of classrooms and gallery space, and a ceramics studio. Each year we present over 200 theatre productions from our resident and visiting companies including the New Rep Theatre, Metro West Opera, Boston Bollywood and more. We also produce over 50 of our own Mosesian Arts Live events including our sold out “earfull” series, which pairs world renowned authors, like Atul Gawande and Dennis Lehane, and musicians, like Howie Day and Patti Larkin, to read and perform their latest works. Our galleries host 8 to 12 exhibitions annually, providing the opportunity for over 400 artists to present and sell their work. This year we will be focusing on accessibility in the arts with our Spring show “please Touch the Art,” a multi-sensory art exhibition that will invite sighted, low vision, and blind audiences to see and touch. We have over 493 members, a growing mailing list of 20,000 and over 125,000 visitors annually. Our patrons come from 68 communities in the greater Boston area, including those with below average median household incomes such as Watertown and Waltham. The MCA continues to be central in the cultural transformation of the Arsenal corridor. All of our exhibits and many of our programs, including our four annual family festivals, are free and open to the public, enabling us to provide access to the arts to people of all socioeconomic backgrounds. Our tuition assistance fund provides full or partial support to those in need. We believe in art for all – art that is accessible regardless of background, identity, or ability. Your continued general operating support makes all of our programs possible."

"Amgen Foundation, Inc.",Health Resources in Action,"20,000",2019,1 year,"Cambridge, MA",Job counseling,Children and youth; Students,Program support; Internships,Cash grants,"The LEAH Project is a STEM-focused program that builds a love of science among low-income youth of color and prepares them to pursue STEM education in college and to pursue careers in STEM, a growing field with well-paying jobs where minorities have historically been under-represented. To this end, LEAH provides its high school-aged participants with training, mentoring, and hands-on work experience in STEM. LEAH is seeking support from the Amgen Foundation to support the LEAH Knox Scholars Biomedical Research Track (LKS) which is aligned with the Foundation's science education and community life priorities. In its second year, the LKS track will provide 45 low-income youth of color from Boston, Cambridge, and Everett with paid experiential workforce training opportunities. Rising juniors and seniors are eligible to participate in a five-week intensive biology course at MIT to gain basic lab skills. The following summer, LKS youth will have paid internships in academic or corporate laboratories where they will apply the skills they learned at MIT. Evaluation of the summer 2018 LKS track's first year found that the students gained valuable skills and became inspired to continue pursuing a science career: 21 of the 26 LKS 2018 cohort will be interns in academic or corporate labs for their second summer in the program. By providing experiential learning opportunities, the LKS track addresses the disparities low-income youth of color face in accessing a STEM career."

Since our founding, Breakthrough has served over 2,500 students and teachers, and over the past eight years, 97% of our graduating seniors have been admitted to college. Breakthrough requests $25,000 to support our Full STEAM Ahead Program, which includes: Summer Core Academic STEM Courses: 7-- 9TH graders engage in rigorous coursework closely aligned with school curriculum in our intensive six-week summer program. We prepare students to succeed in advanced high school science courses, foundational for science-based college degrees and careers. BTGB'S Teaching Fellows receive training, hands-on experience, and mentorship by professional STEM teachers. After School STEAM Workshops: To build upon summer STEM courses, our weekly After School Program engages 7TH and 8TH graders in an array of hands-on STEAM workshops. BTGB'S Vacation Camps offer exciting inquiry-based learning opportunities in partnership with local STEM companies. STEM Career Exposure: Students visit local STEM companies to meet with professionals, complete experiments in a lab setting, and learn about new STEM developments to help them visualize a range of future careers and motivate them to select and work hard in STEM courses."

Professional development opportunities for staff and access to new tools, technology, and experiences will help empower our young artists, inventors, and thinkers in Lawrence to explore their own potential, while developing dynamic portfolios for college and career opportunities. In alignment with Movement City's logic model, our goals are for MC Youth to be financially resilient; skilled and knowledgeable; connected to each other; civically engaged; and prepared with the knowledge and skills to hold institutions and employers accountable. In February 2018, MC members submitted projects for the Global RE@cH Festival in categories for graphic design, photography, Scratch, documentary video, and audio commentary. Members collaborated with Lawrence Boys & Girls Club on a music video which won the Clubhouse Collaboration category. Funding from Best Buy can help scale the creative potential and success of next collaborations. Members presented Photos de Nosotros, a year-long community photography & humanities project, at Harvard Graduate School of Education’s Alumni of Color Conference in March 2018. The conference theme Radicalize, Reimagine, Reconstruct, was an incredible platform for members to share their work as well as learn from other youth and adult community activists. A grant from Best Buy would allow for members to continue developing community impact projects as well as supporting professional opportunities where projects can be shared. In April 2018, we were able to send three staff members to the Clubhouse Network’s Annual Conference. The additional two staff members are also Movement City alumni. As a direct result of our conference experience, MC will be hosting a staff member from Puerta 18, a Clubhouse in Argentina in June 2018. In order to invest in MC youth members, we must invest in the development and growth of staff and alumni."

The program has two complementary strategies: 1) defending the Domestic Worker Law from corporate attack and 2) campaigning to end wage theft among domestic workers. The first strategy addresses a significant corporate effort to exclude au pairs from the protections provided by the Domestic Workers’ Law and basic wage and hour laws. Matahari is working to ensure the continued legal protection of Massachusetts’ au pairs and to increase au pair agencies’ legal compliance. The second strategy focuses on recruiting, organizing, training, fostering the leadership of and developing wage theft campaigns with domestic workers."
