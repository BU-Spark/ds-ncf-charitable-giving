After a recently completed organizational development and reflection process, Close to Home’s leadership has come to the conclusion that it can no longer sustain its programs within the organization’s current infrastructure. As a result, Close to Home has decided to close down the organization and transition its programs to a network of organizations that will continue to grow and develop its work to engage communities in ending violence. A $100K tie-off grant from the NoVo Foundation will support C2H’s transition process, which will begin in June 2014. C2H will leverage NoVo’s funds to document and share key learnings, models, and tools with the broader movement to end domestic and sexual violence and ensure that its programs thrive in their new organizational homes."""
