The JPB Foundation,President and Fellows of Harvard College,"5,000,000",2018,3.25 months,Poverty; Health Equity,University education,Academics,Not Specified,Cash grants,"The main goal of CHOICES Phase 3 is to increase the capacity and actions of local, state and national decision-makers to choose and implement cost-effective and equitable strategies that prevent childhood obesity. We aim to achieve this goal by accomplishing three objectives: 1. To expand our collaborative work with state, city and national partners in using CHOICES cost-effectiveness methods and decision tools. In addition to continuing our in-depth Learning Collaborative Partnerships, we will develop a nationwide CHOICES Community of Practice for cost-effective decision-making for childhood obesity. This will include developing 8 new Learning Collaborative partnerships with state and city health departments, thus engaging a wide variety of new partners and stakeholders in using cost-effectiveness modeling to inform their decision making. We will also continue working with our existing state/city health agency partners and their local partners as we develop a nationwide CHOICES Community of Practice. The CHOICES Community of Practice will include peer-to-peer exchange and learning network opportunities, including tools for cost-effectiveness calculations, and case studies and webinars produced with the Leadership Studio at the Harvard Chan School that highlight state/city health agency experiences. The CHOICES Community of Practice will allow for a collaborative forum for agencies and other partners to work together to develop comprehensive strategies to turn around the obesity epidemic and address equity concerns. 2. To further advance the science on cost-effective obesity prevention, in collaboration with leading researchers, public health professionals, and decision-makers, we will estimate cost-effectiveness and health equity metrics for nine childhood obesity intervention strategies. We will update and expand our evidence reviews and estimate metrics using our CHOICES framework and microsimulation model. We will also update CHOICES microsimulation models by incorporating recent population and health data and health equity metrics. This work will draw upon our experience with evidence reviews and published CHOICES cost- effectiveness evaluations of interventions, as well as modeling work we have completed with state and city partners (more than 50 models). We will thus take advantage of new studies and evidence for effective strategies that can reduce obesity prevalence. Please see expert stakeholder group list sent via email March 5, 2018 by CHOICES team. We will deepen our understanding of how different obesity prevention strategies impact health equity. This work will build on our existing studies of the potential impact of intervention strategies on health disparities, as well as new work that documents the predictability of BMI and obesity risks over the life course, taking into account race/ethnicity specific trajectories (Ward et al. 2017)."

We achieve this mission by providing one-on-one guidance and support to low-income and first-generation students from college applications until college graduation. In our first year, we served 25 Boston high school seniors. As our organization grew, we not only worked with more high school seniors each school year, but also continued to support our students as they began to attend college. Through phone calls, e-mails, campus visits, and steady advising, Bottom Line supported these students for up to 6 years or until they received their college diplomas. In 2008, we opened our first satellite office in Worcester. This year, we opened a third office in New York City. Now Bottom Line is multi-state organization serving over 2,300 students. Since our founding, Bottom Line's services have achieved strong, measurable results: 98% of high school seniors have been accepted to college and 74% of college students have graduated in 6 years or less"

College Bound Dorchester's programming focuses on critical developmental periods in the lives of 900 students each year, from ages 3 months to 27 years, through a dual framework of: 1. Prevention Programming: Early Education and Out of School Time programs for students aged 3 months to 13. 2. Intervention Programming: College Connections which provides college preparation for adolescents and adults aged 14 to 27. This programming is designed to support students, including those involved in traditional educational settings and those who have become disengaged in their education, at key junctures in their lives and to ensure that students stay on the path to college. By providing multiple entry points and a continuum of service, College Bound Dorchester strives to ensure that no student is lost on his or her path to higher education and that all students have the opportunity to realize their goals. College Bound's goal, and ultimately the goal for all of its programs, is for each student to enroll in and graduate from college. College Bound's model to achieve this goal is implemented through the College Connections program and focuses on two areas, skills and motivation, and is done within the context of connections, high expectations and deep engagement. College Bound works with students through a youth development framework that provides them with academic instruction, mentoring support and enrichment opportunities. Above all else, educators meet our youth where they are and walk with them to a place they never believed they could be"

Over the past four years, The Food Project has created and facilitated a “dudley Grows” resident steering committee to imagine and inspire food system change in this community, formulating a vision of a food system that builds neighborhood wealth and expands real access to healthy food for lower-income residents. The committee has articulated the following priorities that direct the resources of The Food Project: a resident-owned supply chain for fresh, healthy food; vacant land permanently secured for growing; and school food that ensures children are well-nourished with food they enjoy. The Food Project believes that youth are effective and necessary agents in positively changing attitudes around growing food, supporting healthier eating habits, and promoting local food. We hire 60 young people across three tiers of a nationally-renowned youth leadership development program. Young people in the introductory summer crew are responsible for growing over 140,000 pounds of food during the growing season, while seasoned youth in the more advanced crews lead our community engagement efforts including building raised-bed gardens, managing farmers markets, working directly with local businesses, and offering workshops for gardeners and other residents. A 31-acre suburban farm in Lincoln provides additional produce for the market, food donations, and to supply locally-owned corner stores and restaurants in Dudley."

To this end, LEAH provides its high school-aged participants with training, mentoring, and hands-on work experience in STEM. LEAH is seeking support from the Amgen Foundation to support the LEAH Knox Scholars Biomedical Research Track (LKS) which is aligned with the Foundation's science education and community life priorities. Over the next year, the LKS track will provide 46 low-income youth of color from Boston, Cambridge, and Everett with paid experiential workforce training opportunities. Rising juniors and seniors are eligible to participate in a five-week intensive biology course at MIT to gain basic lab skills. The following summer, LKS youth will have paid internships in academic or corporate laboratories where they will apply the skills they learned at MIT. Evaluation of the summer 2017 LKS track pilot found that the students gained valuable skills and became inspired to pursue college to advance their science knowledge. By providing experiential learning opportunities, the LKS track addresses the disparities low-income youth of color face in accessing the rigorous academic preparation necessary to succeed in college-level science courses."

Since our initial work with FHD in 2011, we have participated in the community planning process initiated by the Investing In Girls Alliance (IIGA) and subsequently by the WISH Task Force. We are aligned with WISHs strategic plan and specifically goal two, to improve quality sexual health education. We propose a three-year plan for implementation of a culturally responsive gender specific program to support healthy relationships and build positive futures for Worcesters middle school girls. Our program is built on the Girls Circle model and enhanced to address the unique needs of the girls served by our diverse organizations. The framework is a gender specific afterschool program for 7th & 8th grade girls; running 4 hours a week throughout with the school year. Each partner site will engage a total of 135 girls over three years. In addition, 100 families will participate in family academies. The program will provide programming at each site, joint activities across all sites and family engagement activities throughout the year. Topics include: Identity and Culture- self-expression and positive cultural identity, Healthy Relationships –healthy romantic relationships, human sexuality, and self confidence, Leadership- developing leadership, team building, and career exploration. A capstone project will engage girls in a multimedia campaign to promote healthy lives and healthy choices. Family Academies support family learning and discussion aligned with the three core topics. Year one will include a planning and outreach component for the first three months and a year program pilot to ensure our program is solidly built on the unique needs of our target populations."

Since our initial work with FHD in 2011, we have participated in the community planning process initiated by the Investing In Girls Alliance (IIGA) and subsequently by the WISH Task Force. We are aligned with WISHs strategic plan and specifically goal two, to improve quality sexual health education. We propose a three-year plan for implementation of a culturally responsive gender specific program to support healthy relationships and build positive futures for Worcesters middle school girls. Our program is built on the Girls Circle model and enhanced to address the unique needs of the girls served by our diverse organizations. The framework is a gender specific afterschool program for 7th & 8th grade girls; running 4 hours a week throughout with the school year. Each partner site will engage a total of 135 girls over three years. In addition, 100 families will participate in family academies. The program will provide programming at each site, joint activities across all sites and family engagement activities throughout the year. Topics include: Identity and Culture- self-expression and positive cultural identity, Healthy Relationships –healthy romantic relationships, human sexuality, and self confidence, Leadership- developing leadership, team building, and career exploration. A capstone project will engage girls in a multimedia campaign to promote healthy lives and healthy choices. Family Academies support family learning and discussion aligned with the three core topics. Year one will include a planning and outreach component for the first three months and a year program pilot to ensure our program is solidly built on the unique needs of our target populations."

"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.",Family Health Center Of Worcester Inc,"15,000",2018,1 year,Health,Mental health care,Victims of crime and abuse,Program support,Cash grants,"We respectfully request continued funding for general operating expenses for the Healthcare for Homeless Families Program (HCHF) at Family Health Center of Worcester (FHCW). HCHF provides trauma-informed healthcare with intensive case management for homeless families living in area family shelters and domestic violence shelters, as well as families who are identified as homeless during a health care visit and referred by their physician. The goals of the program are to identify and treat the underlying health issues and trauma that contribute to homelessness; and to support families as they make progress on the path to stability and self-sufficiency. HCHF is designed to address the underlying causes of a family's homeless episode, and treat the physical and/or mental health conditions that may contribute to job loss, housing loss, the exhaustion of families' support systems and subsequent shelter placements. For over 27 years, the HCHF has been the only program in Worcester to provide comprehensive access to health care for homeless family members of all ages, including coordinated and integrated case management, access to behavioral health care, and trauma-informed primary care. HCHF assists the most vulnerable families in our community by providing wrap-around services at FHCW structured with an awareness of the high rate of violence and other trauma experienced by homeless families. HCHF employs two case managers (Family Advocates) to provide family support so that families emerge from their time in shelter with the tools to navigate the healthcare system for themselves and their families, and to continue treatment of any conditions that contributed to homelessness. We request funding to support these non-reimbursable case management services needed to provide wrap around, trauma-informed care for the growing number of homeless families in Worcester."

Participants are likely to represent communities of color, live in poverty, have been exposed to substance abuse, gang violence, health disparities, interpersonal violence, homelessness, etc. They are also likely to be the first in their families to attend college. The funding would support both general operation of the Girls CHOICE program and expansion of the program to include the YWCA’s Young Women’s Leadership Program (YWLP). YWLP is a 12-week leadership development program conducted by female adult community leaders. Girls CHOICE has a documented history of improving the lives of Worcester girls, especially girls of color, by helping middle and high school girls to: • Increase their rates of graduation • Reduce the incidence of violence in their lives • Recognize and understand the qualities of healthy and unhealthy relationships • Learn about and develop goal setting and planning skills • Develop positive relationships and values Through the program's long-term structure and support, girls develop the skills, habits, resiliency, and relationships needed for them to become self-reliant adults."

Tuition-free options are likely to be less structured, less supported, and less focused on academics. Science Club for Girls (SCFG) offers a suite of programs, C.E.L.L.S., That are specifically designed to help teens address barriers of access to high-quality STEM education. One of these programs is called Challenge Teams. With the support of the Best Buy Foundation, we intend to expand the capacity of our most popular Challenge Team: Tech Team. As we continue to offer more middle school STEMinistas programs to address demand from girls advancing out of our K-5 programs, we will, in turn, have a growing need for teen programs. Expanding the capacity of Tech Team helps to address this demand. We will be able to reach new participants from low-income families. Expanding Tech Team also allows us to offer high-demand programs that provide participants the opportunity to learn from professional mentors and also compete to showcase their knowledge and skills on a regional and national level. Our goals are to reduce barriers of access and to improve girls’ attitudes towards science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), increase girls' academic confidence through engaging experiential curriculum, and bolster the resilience of adolescent girls through programs that support their socio-emotional development."

This program provides adult English and U.S. Citizenship classes, an Early Literacy Playgroup, guided parent-child literacy activities, and family outreach support services to African refugee and immigrant families in Worcester, MA. The need for English literacy is significant among the African population in the City of Worcester, with 1,497 African refugees resettled here between FY2006 to FY2017, and new families continuing to arrive. Overall, the population of African-born residents in Worcester is estimated at 8,444. We will provide Family Education programming on Saturday mornings from 8:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. from October 2018 through June 2019, for a total of 25 sessions. We will provide year-round, wraparound outreach support to 50 families. We developed this program with the support of the Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, and have built partnerships with Worcester Public Schools’ Adult Learning Center and Worcester Family Partnership to provide free teachers and build sustainability into the program. With your continued support, we will expand to serve 25 adults and 30 children. Specifically, funds from Daniels would support hours for our Family Education Coordinator; hours for 1 additional program support staff; hours for Outreach Workers; bus tickets to get 10 students to and from program; and breakfast."

"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.",Bottom Line,"5,000",2018,1 year,"Education (schools, colleges)",Higher education,Children and youth; Low-income people; Students,Program support,Cash grants,"Bottom Line respectfully requests a $10,000 investment from the Fred Harris Daniels Foundation to support Bottom Line’s program and operations in Worcester for the 2017-2018 program year. Twenty years ago, Bottom Line opened its doors with a high-impact, one-on-one coaching program aiming to increase the graduation rate for low-income, first-generation-to-college students in Massachusetts. Only one in eleven low-income students that get into college actually graduate and Bottom Line has developed a proven model to ensure students are four times more likely to graduate. Our Access counselors help students get into college. Then they go a step further by ensuring students are making the right choice, looking at academic, financial, and personal fit to get students to start their college career on solid footing. Our Success counselors travel to college campuses to meet with students in-person multiple times throughout the year with a codified curriculum to ensure they can overcome any obstacles that might get in the way of earning their degree. Thanks to these programs, over 78% percent of our students have earned a college degree within six years. Through our programs we empower students to take ownership of their educational journeys and build self-confidence, so they can advocate for themselves within their institutions. This year, we are expanding our work in Worcester to serve approximately 418 college students and are also supporting a new cohort of 100 Worcester high school seniors through the entire college application process. In order to ensure our impact on the region is sustainable, we have added a Site Director to support the daily operations of the Worcester office and grow our community partnerships as well as our funder base in the community."

Opened by and for Worcester youth, WYC has evolved to offering an array of services to disconnected/at-risk youth, ages 14-24. Program areas include: Health, Recreation and Positive Social Interaction; Creative Expression and Leadership; Academic Support; and Work Readiness. Youth also receive case management and/or ancillary services provided on site through partner organizations. Staff conducts intensive outreach to engage youth who face barriers to educational/employment success. Using a Youth Development Model, youth are supported in developing, and working toward, life goals as they move to adulthood. In 2017, 800 youth attended the Center; 375 attendees actively participated in programs. Membership is 62% male and diverse. WYC’s service area includes all of Worcester’s poorest neighborhoods; youth face low academic success, foster care/juvenile justice involvement, homelessness, teen pregnancy, and substance use/dependency. WYC is at the forefront of providing Youth Violence Prevention services. WYC serves youth who have similar profiles but who have not been referred through a formal program, as well as disconnected female youth who face the same environmental/familial risk factors as their male peers; who may be victims and/or perpetrators of violence; and who may have associations with gangs/gang members."

We achieve this mission by providing one-on-one guidance and support to low-income and first-generation students from college applications until college graduation. In our first year, we served 25 Boston high school seniors. As our organization grew, we not only worked with more high school seniors each school year, but also continued to support our students as they began to attend college. Through phone calls, e-mails, campus visits, and steady advising, Bottom Line supported these students for up to 6 years or until they received their college diplomas. In 2008, we opened our first satellite office in Worcester. This year, we opened a third office in New York City. Now Bottom Line is multi-state organization serving over 2,300 students. Since our founding, Bottom Line's services have achieved strong, measurable results: 98% of high school seniors have been accepted to college and 74% of college students have graduated in 6 years or less"

Not Specified,The Food Project,"50,000",2017,1 year,Nutrition,Organic farming,Adolescents; Ethnic and racial groups; Low-income people,Not Specified,Cash grants,"Come to Dudley and it is clear: the neighborhood cares deeply about its food. The neighborhood is full of gardens built by The Food Project and are tended by more than 600 gardeners. The Food Project's two-acres of urban farmland and 10,000 square-foot greenhouse act as gardener hubs, and many can be seen at our farmers market that sells over 85,000 servings of affordable, SNAP-accessible fresh local produce to residents. Along with more than 20 years of donating food to local soup kitchens and food pantries—more than 45,000 pounds of produce annually—our youth leadership programming has built trust in the community as 60 young people inspire locals to take control of their food access through our initiatives. The Food Project knows—given its extensive research into the Dudley residents' vision for the food system—that Dudley residents want to purchase fresh food at locally-owned businesses. The task that faces us is how to mobilize that desire, to break habits, and make it financially viable for low-income residents to purchase fresh food at cornerstores committing to offering that food. To do this, The Food Project will: -supply $15,000 of fresh food to locally-owned cornerstores at viable prices for business and consumer. -Conduct a “support Dudley-grown Fresh Food” campaign to highlight fresh local food at cornerstores and to encourage cafes and restaurants to have a ‘local food special' on their menus. -Offer ‘eat Well' cooking workshops to assist residents in utilizing fresh food in culturally appropriate, nutritious, and delicious recipes at low cost. -Trial a SNAP-matching pilot at a local cornerstore, doubling the purchasing power of low-income consumers without cost to the business. The Food Project will also continue to establish resident-controlled growing spaces and inspire more residents to participate in growing, as part of this comprehensive plan to change how Dudley residents consume food and build a sustainable food system."

A two-year $100,000 grant will: engage 350 Core Influencers, ensure 130 matriculate to college and 85% don’t recidivate, and begin to assess the student-/community-level impact. To break the neighborhood hold of gangs and build a culture of opportunity, Uncornered is working with the city to provide a college access/success pathway to 20% of Core Influencers in six “hotspots” of crime (targeting both sides of three gang conflicts) - unlocking the full potential of our distressed neighborhoods and the entire city. The 3-year initiative will scale our work and conduct an external evaluation to build an evidence-based, replicable College Connections model of change to expand to cities across America."

College Bound Dorchester's programming focuses on critical developmental periods in the lives of 900 students each year, from ages 3 months to 27 years, through a dual framework of: 1. Prevention Programming: Early Education and Out of School Time programs for students aged 3 months to 13. 2. Intervention Programming: College Connections which provides college preparation for adolescents and adults aged 14 to 27. This programming is designed to support students, including those involved in traditional educational settings and those who have become disengaged in their education, at key junctures in their lives and to ensure that students stay on the path to college. By providing multiple entry points and a continuum of service, College Bound Dorchester strives to ensure that no student is lost on his or her path to higher education and that all students have the opportunity to realize their goals. College Bound's goal, and ultimately the goal for all of its programs, is for each student to enroll in and graduate from college. College Bound's model to achieve this goal is implemented through the College Connections program and focuses on two areas, skills and motivation, and is done within the context of connections, high expectations and deep engagement. College Bound works with students through a youth development framework that provides them with academic instruction, mentoring support and enrichment opportunities. Above all else, educators meet our youth where they are and walk with them to a place they never believed they could be"
