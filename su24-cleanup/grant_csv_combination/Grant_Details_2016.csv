Transforming Justice (TJ) works to address the brutality, racial bias, and inhumanity that pervades the criminal justice system, and seeks to transform criminal justice institutions through mindfulness-based practices and principles. TJ'S primary strategy is to work with criminal justice professionals, training them in mindfulness-based skills that help them cope with the mental, emotional, and physical toll of their work, while also shaping their behavior and decision-making in a way that fosters greater fairness, compassion, and respect for the dignity of all those they encounter. Major programs include establishing mindfulness as an important skill for attorneys and judges, building a national movement for mindfulness in criminal justice, and the San Jose Project which engages with criminal justice leaders in San Jose to explore how this approach might be implemented throughout an entire jurisdiction."

Family Health Center of Worcester currently provides services for over 33,000 area residents. Phase 2 of the project includes renovations to refresh paint and flooring in 56,000 square feet of existing health center clinical and teaching space to update and repair the facility; construct new nurses stations on 3 existing clinical teams to allow more efficient workflow and consistent work spaces; renovate two storage spaces to convert to office space for improved patient confidentiality in HIV counseling and testing, and health education; and replace aged equipment in disrepair throughout the health center to assure sustainability of operations well into the future."

At Plumley Village (TCB) are pleased to submit this proposal for enhancement and implementation of our One Circle program for middle school aged girls in Worcester. Since our initial work with FHD in 2011, we have participated in the community planning process initiated by the Investing In Girls Alliance (IIGA) and subsequently by the WISH Task Force. We are aligned with WISHs strategic plan and specifically goal two, to improve quality sexual health education. We propose a three-year plan for implementation of a culturally responsive gender specific program to support healthy relationships and build positive futures for Worcesters middle school girls. Our program is built on the Girls Circle model and enhanced to address the unique needs of the girls served by our diverse organizations. The framework is a gender specific afterschool program for 7TH & 8TH grade girls; running 4 hours a week throughout with the school year. Each partner site will engage a total of 135 girls over three years. In addition, 100 families will participate in family academies. The program will provide programming at each site, joint activities across all sites and family engagement activities throughout the year. Topics include: Identity and Culture- self-expression and positive cultural identity, Healthy Relationships –healthy romantic relationships, human sexuality, and self confidence, Leadership- developing leadership, team building, and career exploration. A capstone project will engage girls in a multimedia campaign to promote healthy lives and healthy choices. Family Academies support family learning and discussion aligned with the three core topics. Year one will include a planning and outreach component for the first three months and a year program pilot to ensure our program is solidly built on the unique needs of our target populations."

The Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation,Eco City Farms,"20,000",2016,1 year,Nutrition Programs,Nutrition,People of African descent; Low-income people,"Policy, advocacy and systems reform; Program support",Cash grants,"The funding requested from the Morris & Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation will provide general support for ECO City Farms for our full range of food justice work. ECO City Farms serves the low income and working class, largely Black and Latino populations of inner Capital Beltway communities, particularly the Port Towns municipalities of Bladensburg, Colmar Manor, Cottage City and Edmonston in Prince George's County and near-in Washington, DC. ECO creates greater access to and knowledge about healthy food in these communities. All of the USDA-certified food deserts inside the Beltway are in Prince George's County. Many neighborhoods lack an adequately stocked grocery within a mile's radius of their homes, and many county families rely instead on highly processed meals, often saturated with transfats, salt and sugar. The county's Planning Department documents that 71% of all county restaurants are fast food, and the Maryland State Department of Mental Health notes that in Prince George's County, 71.4% Of adults are overweight/obese and childhood obesity figures are rising. Diabetes and diet-related illnesses have reached epidemic proportions. In its Urban Agriculture Report, Policy Link says studies consistently show that there are fewer retail outlets selling affordable, nutritious food in low-income communities than in wealthier ones, and fewer in predominantly African American and Latino neighborhoods than in predominantly white neighborhoods. However, they also report that residents with greater access to fresh produce consume healthier diets and have lower rates of diet-related diseases than their counterparts in neighborhoods lacking food access. Unless area residents are able to access more healthy food and become more conscious of what and how they eat, the already alarming rates of obesity, chronic illness and early death will continue to rise. ECO not only built and maintains two urban farms in the county, we also make healthy food affordable and accessible in a variety of ways, and teach residents how to farm and garden, prepare nutritious food for their families and to live healthy lives in greater harmony with nature. In 2015, approximately 5,000 individuals were served by ECO through its CSA, Farmer's Market sales, Community Nutrition Education and Community College courses, Summer Youth Programs, community events and outreach activities. In the coming year, an anticipated 7,000 individuals will be served by ECO's work."

The goal of Youthconnect is to establish a seamless, inclusive youth-serving system; a consortium modeled on best practices and built on a framework that delivers positive outcomes for health, education, and family stability to youth in Worcester’s highest need neighborhoods. Youthconnect emerged from the very successful Youthnet collaboration providing culturally competent developmental summer programs to Worcester's middle school youth for 20 years. Partners include: Boys & Girls Club of Worcester, Friendly House, Girls Inc. Of Worcester, YMCA of Central MA, Y.O.U. Inc., YWCA of Central MA, The Nativity School, The HOPE Coalition and Worcester Youth Center. These partners share a commitment to provide year round youth development opportunities to youth who reside in Worcester’s highest environments. The Summer of 2016 program will operate tentatively June 27 through August 12. Each weeknight, one recreational facility per team will be open, 5:30PM - 9:30PM for a host of activities, subject to facility availability. Activities typically include: aerobics, arts and crafts, basketball, cooking, games, movies, swimming, volleyball, etc. More structured activities, including basketball tournaments will be determined after the first few weeks of operation. For Youthnet to maximize its effect and service the cities youth who are most at risk, we recognize the need for full time staff to be out in the community during the afternoon hours developing relationships and building trust with our youth. Each afternoon the Team Leader and 2 full time staff will be out in there target neighborhoods from 2PM to 4PM recruitment and conducting neighborhood based programs."

GLI began as a single summer camp that expanded into five programs: Summer Camp, Parent-daughter Workshops, Professional Development Training, After School, and Day Camp; working in five states: California, Colorado, New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Novo's funding supports a one-day training led by Race Forward that was held in March 2016. The training and consultation helped GLI develop a shared language on racial and social justice; an understanding of the structural and institutional racism that we swim in daily in US culture; and helped them develop a framework for further conversations within the organization."

Arcus Foundation,History Unerased Inc,"5,000",2016,0.33 months,Social Justice,Education,Children and youth; LGBTQ people; Students,Program support,Cash grants,"For support for the LGBTQ Youth Leadership Development Project. Support for this project will ensure that History Unerased (HUE) offers internship opportunities for young people that create new leaders and contributors to the evolving work toward LGBTQ equality. HUE interns will be directly involved within each arm of HUE’s programs and services, including: working directly with the National Park Service LGBT Heritage Commission for the nomination of Concord Academy as a registered historic landmark, expanding HUE’s social media presence to appeal more directly to youth, and assisting in the development of complementing materials associated with the Give Voice to History project with Eric Marcus. Building a strong infrastructure, which includes salaries for interns, development of groundbreaking products and trainings, as well as consulting with Queer Studies scholars, enables the flexibility needed for HUE’s organizational success. Employing young interns will ensure that this vital history and its intersections with other marginalized histories reach as many youth as possible, and that our youth have opportunities to play a vital leadership role in the process of linking social justice and educational materials for the K-12 context. One in five LGBTQ youth of color will attempt suicide; 45% of all homeless youth identify as LGBTQ; LGBTQ youth are 30% more likely to drop out of school and 60% more likely to skip school. The invisibility of LGBTQ history, people and content within our nation’s schools significantly contributes to these staggering statistics. GLSEN reports that positive lessons about LGBTQ people can mitigate this crisis dramatically. Including the stories and voices of all people, especially those who have been historically marginalized, is a direct path to social justice, equity and agency."

This program provides adult English and U.S. Citizenship classes, an Early Literacy Playgroup, guided parent-child literacy activities, and family outreach support services to African refugee and immigrant families in Worcester, MA. The need for English literacy is significant among the African population in the City of Worcester, with nearly 1,000 African refugees being resettled here between FY2006 to FY2014, and new families continuing to arrive. Overall, the population of African-born residents in Worcester is estimated at 7,973. We will provide Family Education programming on Saturday mornings from 9:00 A.M. To 1:30 P.M. From October 2016 through June 2017, for a total of 32 sessions. We will provide wraparound outreach support to families on a year-round basis. We developed this program with the support of the Daniels Foundation, and have created partnerships with Worcester Public Schools’ Adult Learning Center and the Worcester Family Partnership to provide free teachers and build sustainability into the program. With your continued support, we will be able to continue to provide services to 18 adults and 25 youth. Specifically, funds from Daniels would support hours for our Family Education & Outreach Coordinator to coordinate the adult classes, playgroup and literacy activities; hours for the Citizenship Teacher and program support staff; and hours for 4 Outreach Workers to provide wraparound support to families."

Founded in 1994, the Center has evolved from a drop-in center for young adults and adolescents in Worcester to a center with much greater capacity, serving more youth and offering a wider variety of programs and transitional support activities promoting positive youth development. The Youth Center has a host of activities in which young people can get involved. The youth can choose to enroll in more than one activity and attend year round. Or, they can obtain discreet support either one time or periodically throughout the year. Activities are grouped into four programs: Academic Support, Creative Expression & Leadership, Health/Wellness, and Work Preparation. We are requesting support to help fund the operations of the Center so that we can continue to provide the core programs that fulfill our mission. Most of our contracts do not cover the cost of operating our facility and most often do not allow for more than 5-10% for overhead. All the funds requested are for necessary services that allow the WYC to function. Failure to fund these operations compromises our programs which impacts the youth we serve."

"The Fred Harris Daniels Foundation, Inc.",Bottom Line,"4,000",2016,1 year,Youth,Higher education,Adolescents; Low-income people; Students,Program support,Cash grants,"In 2015-2016, Bottom Line will continue its growth trajectory and expand to serve about 530 low-income and first-generation high school and college students from Worcester. Access Program: Bottom Line is working with 130 students in their senior year of high school to help them navigate every step of the college application process. Counselors typically help students in five areas: generating a list of colleges suited to students’ academic and financial situations, writing essays, completing applications, securing financial aid, and making a college choice. Working with a caseload of approximately 60 students, counselors build a strong relationship with each student during regularly scheduled one-hour meetings. Success Program: After our Access students make their college decisions, we invite those who choose to attend one of 24 “target” colleges in Massachusetts to join our Success Program. For the first time, in 2015-2016 we will also welcome a handful of rising college freshmen from Worcester into the Success Program who did not received our support applying to college. We have pioneered this innovation, which we call Success Direct, in Boston and New York and are excited to bring it to Worcester. Once students arrive on campus, Bottom Line counselors continue to work one-on-one and in-person with a caseload of 80 to 90 students. Using our codified curriculum, counselors offer regular support in the four areas most likely to cause a student to drop out of college: Degree, Employability, (financial) Aid, and Life, or DEAL. Once students enter the junior year of college they are assigned a career counselor who continues to use the DEAL model but with a heightened focus on a career curriculum designed to make sure they are prepared for the workforce upon graduation. Services include assessing career paths, writing resumes and cover letters, networking skills, securing internships, and finding jobs."
